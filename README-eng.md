## Formats

Each operator's voice files in Arknights (including skin-specific voiceovers) consist of dozens of "voice clips". To facilitate storage, transmission and management, all "voice clips" of an operator are combined into a single "integrated voice file" for storage.

In this repo, voice files are categorized and stored in separate directories by language, consistent with the game's internal resource structure. The `voice_data.json` dataset file in the root directory provides detailed information about each operator's voice data, making it easy to find which languages are available for an operator and the starting timestamp of a specific "voice clip" within an "integrated voice file" for that language.

All audio files are encoded in OGG Vorbis format (mono, 44100Hz, 16bit), balancing efficient compression and fidelity to the game's original audio quality. The average size of an operator's "integrated voice file" is approximately 2.1MB.
